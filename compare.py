"""Compare already-trained RNN implementations side by side.

Training is done by the caller (the notebook), which keeps the slow framework
training out of this function and lets you compare whatever set of models you
have on hand — all three (manual / TensorFlow / PyTorch) or just the manual one.

`compare_models` takes a ``{name: trained_model}`` mapping plus the train/test
data and generation settings, and prints train/test accuracy (or MSE) and a
sample generation for each model. Every model only needs a ``predict`` method
and ``n_x``/``n_y``/``task`` attributes — which the manual RNN and both
framework wrappers all provide.
